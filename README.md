![Adventure Planner](public/images/Project-Screenshots/title.png)  

Plan a an adventure, or find an adventure that you already planned. Plan your adventures in the winter and don't waste time during the summer.

## Intro
----
This app is a personal adventure planner that a user can use when researching hikes, or backpacking trips to keep track of critical details. 

## Background
----
This app was built with the main user persona being my own attempts to research different types of adventures. Sites like [Washington Trails Association][1] are great for discovering new hikes and finding reviews, but their feature for allowing users to plan out their own adventures is lacking. The following elements were prelimenary requirements: 
- The user's entries must be private to each user, because researching hikes and backpacking trips is serious business
- The user needs to be able to search for hikes already entered by region or by type of adventure
- The app should be tailored to the user's geography- The app's current version is specific to the Pacific Northwest
- The user should be able to store a photo and useful links for more context and planning
- The user must be able to add different adventures related to the current one, just in case a hike could also be a backpacking trip and visa-versa


## Planning 
----
This project was planned out using [Trello][2] to list out user stories, progress, and to link to wireframes and ER diagrams.

## Next Steps / Ice Box
----

There are a number of items in the [ice box][2] for this project. Since planning is based on weather, a nice weather map will feature on the dashboard to help the user in choosing an adventure they have already planned. Other items of note:
- Comments for keeping notes
- Cataloging adventures that have already been experienced
- New types of adventures, such as alpine scrambles and rock climbing
- A feature for notifying emergency contacts of adventure plans
